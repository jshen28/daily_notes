## INSTALL MODULE WITH CPAN

    I came cross some problems when I try to install modules using cpan. It turns out that problems lays in [make has not been installed](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23293589/perl-module-install-error-cpan) and also I have to use sudo to get the proper privilege writing to certain directory.
    After a lot struggles, I succeed installing moduels with cpan.

## PRINT SET OUTPUT CHARACTER ENCODING

### DEAL WITH STDOUT

    STDOUT is a predefined variable point to standard output. When printing utf-8 characters to it under strict mode, to remove warning message, following code is helpful.

```perl
    binmode( STDOUT, "utf8" );
```

### DEAL WITH FILE

    Deal with outputing to a file can be done by the following code. ( [this link is helpful](http://perldoc.perl.org/functions/open.html) )

```perl
    my $file_name = "your file name";
    open my $fp, ">:encoding(UTF-8)", $file_name;
```

## USING DBI TO EXECUTING MYSQL QUERIES

    1. Install [DBI](http://search.cpan.org/~timb/DBI-1.639/DBI.pm)
    I prefer installing with span or spanm, it makes life much easier...

```shell
    cpanm DBI;
    # cpan; install DBI;
```

    2. Install MySQL server or mysqlclient-dev
    For ubuntu, [using the following command](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4729722/trying-to-install-perl-mysql-dbd-mysql-config-cant-be-found)

```shell
    sudo apt-get install -y mysql-server

    # following command might introduce error during make test
    # so need to pass test phase
    # sudo apt-get install -y mysqlclient-dev
```
