## ACCESS FILE WITHOUT PERMISSION ON FOLDER

It is neccessary to **gain execution privilege** on folders along the path in order to read its contents. Note user may not need read or write right, according to [this post](https://askubuntu.com/questions/83788/accessing-files-in-a-directory-without-x-permission).

```sh
# ROOT
mkdir -p test
chmod 711 test
echo "Hello World" > test/hello.txt

# change user to ubuntu
su ubuntu

# print out Hello World
echo test/hello.txt
```
